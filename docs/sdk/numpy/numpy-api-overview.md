# Numpy APIs

These api's were designed and built for training a foundational Blender AI model.

## Extract Tensor Weights

::: bw.np.extract_weights

## Matrix Transformations - How to fit a square into smaller square

### Fit 2D Arrays into a different 2D Shape

::: bw.np.fit_2d_arrays_to_target_shape

### Downscale 2D Array to a different 2D Shape

::: bw.np.downscale_2d_array

### Upscale 2D Array to a different 2D Shape

::: bw.np.upscale_2d_array

## Coloring based off Weighted Percentile with Quantiles

Coloring is not recommended when rendering more than 1 model layer with over 100,000 polygon shape faces.

### Calculate 2D Quantile Ranges

::: bw.np.calculate_weighted_quantile_ranges_2d

### Calculate DD Quantile Ranges

::: bw.np.calculate_weighted_quantile_ranges_3d

## Testing

### Generate 2D Arrays with random float32 data

Generate random 2d arrays

::: bw.np.create_random_2d_arrays
